Generates an image using directional lights, point lights, ambient lights, specular and diffuse. 

Completion Path Tracer:
Allows objects to be reflective. In the scene 'Shapes', a square, sphere, plane, disc and triangle are drawn. 

Challenge:
When using the challenge path tracer in the shapes scene, the shapes use a texture.
Challenge path tracer also uses stochastic/distributed ray tracing.
